New to Gantry 5?
-----
If you are new to Gantry 5, a good place to start would be our [dedicated Gantry documentation](http://docs.gantry.org).

As a Grav user, you are most likely accustomed to editing modules when working with our Gantry 4 themes. While our RocketLauncher package contains modules for our subpages, the Home page content is specifically found in the theme's Layout. This can be found via your **Grav administrator -> Extensions -> Themes - > Home -> Layout**. Click on any of the cog icons on the Particles to edit the content.

Typography is an important instrument in not only the site design, but how your content is portrayed and utilized by your visitors. Therefore, Orion offers a rich selection of elegant typography to provide focus to varying content types.

## Responsive

Orion is a responsive theme which means it adapts to the viewing device's width, such as mobile, tablet or desktop. Mobile modes have a unique menu to aid usability. Support classes can also be used to display or hide various types of content for each device.

## Inheritance
