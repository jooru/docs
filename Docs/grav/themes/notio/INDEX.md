Typography is an important instrument in not only the site design, but how your content is portrayed and utilized by your visitors. Therefore, Notio offers a rich selection of elegant typography to provide focus to varying content types.

## Responsive

Notio is a responsive theme which means it adapts to the viewing device's width, such as mobile, tablet or desktop. Mobile modes have a unique menu to aid usability. Support classes can also be used to display or hide various types of content for each device.

## Inheritance

Notio takes full advantage of Gantryâ€™s new inheritance system, making it easier than ever to configure and manage your website through synced particles, atoms, sections, and layouts. Save time by using inheritance to avoid repetitive changes!
