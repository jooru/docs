## Dynamic Header

![Layout Manager](ft-2.jpg)

The Dynamic, Scrolling Header, is a custom design feature that adds an animation effect the header, where the logo and menu are contained, whereby the header elegantly collapses upon downward scroll and smoothly reappears on upward scroll.

## Color Chooser

![Style Settings](ft-3.jpg)

Anacron has an extensive Color Chooser in the template manager to provide intricate controls for each section of Anacron, inclusive of overlay type, text color, background color, as well as background images. Edit preexisting or create new presets
