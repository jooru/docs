The theme features a diverse collection of new particles, to enrich your site content. Xenon debuts Chartist, a visually stunning graphical chart display script, alongside the News Slider and News ticker particles, amongst several others.

## Responsive

![Responsive](ft-3.jpg)

Xenon is a responsive theme which means it adapts to the viewing device's width, such as mobile, tablet or desktop. Mobile modes have a unique menu to aid usability. Support classes can also be used to display or hide various types of content for each device.

## Inheritance

Xenon takes full advantage of Gantryâ€™s new inheritance system, making it easier than ever to configure and manage your website through synced particles, atoms, sections, and layouts. Save time by using inheritance to avoid repetitive changes!
