The Dropdown Menu is an advanced, CSS based menu system, which offers a wide range of per menu item options, such as: inline subtext, icons, images, custom column widths and number, as well as control over how menu items are distributed between columns.

## Responsive

Audacity is a responsive theme which means it adapts to the viewing device's width, such as mobile, tablet or desktop. Mobile modes have a unique menu to aid usability. Support classes can also be used to display or hide various types of content for each device.
