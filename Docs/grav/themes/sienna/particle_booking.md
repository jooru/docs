## Introduction

![](assets/particle_booking1.jpg)

The **Booking Form** particle is a Simple Form powered form enabling visitors to contact you about booking and availability. This is especially useful for hotels, event venues, and other businesses that regularly take reservations.

Of course, like any particle, this can also be customized to connect to any number of different booking systems with a little know-how. By default, it uses the Simple Form service which is a clean, simple way to receive contact information and gather other details about your customer's interest in your products/services. Simple Form will email you each time the form is filled out and submitted by a visitor, along with the information you need to set up reservations.

You will need a Simple Form token in order for this particle to work. You can get one from [Simple Form's website](https://getsimpleform.com/) with your email address. They will email a token to you, and you can easily insert it into the **Simple Form Token** field of the particle. Once this is done, any submissions will be emailed to you as well as made available through the Simple Form website in a private link emailed along with your token.

### Item Options

These items make up the individual featured items in the particle. They sit apart from the particle's title and introduction. Each item can have its own properties. 

These items are each part of the whole particle. Essentially, a single item is a single question you want to have answered by the visitor submitting the form. The date of arrival, departure, number of people, etc. are all individual items.
