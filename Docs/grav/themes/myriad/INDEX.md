Introduction
-----

![](assets/myriad.jpeg)

Myriad is the first RocketTheme Club theme to be ported from Gantry 4 to Gantry 5. Myriad centers around photography, providing an elegantly designed, visual space for the display of full width gallery items and slideshows. The structure allows for the promotion of images, whilst maintaining a refined style for more conservative appearances.

## Content Animations

![Layout Manager](ft-2.jpg)

The theme makes uses of animated effects to add depth and character to content, without compromising on usability and professionalism. A series of bounce and slide effects are built into Myriad, as triggered by scroll events, with an option to disable them.

## Color Chooser

![Style Settings](ft-3.jpg)

Myriad has an extensive Color Chooser in the theme manager to provide intricate controls for each section, inclusive of overlay type, text color, background color, as well as accent colors. Edit preexisting or create new presets.

## Responsive

![Responsive](ft-4.jpg)

Myriad is a responsive theme which means it adapts to the viewing device's width, such as mobile, tablet or desktop. Mobile modes have a unique menu to aid usability. Support classes can also be used to display or hide various types of content for each device.
