The theme features a range of custom particles, including Popup Grid, a mosaic styled content element. It supports a custom modal effect which is a full screen overlay for an enlarged image and full length content items, with easy configuration.

## Menu Overlay

Isotope features two custom menu options. The Menu Overlay is displayed in a fixed, full width overlay, with support for additional blocks. An inline, horizontal option is also available, with Headroom support for dynamic scrolling.

## Responsive

Isotope is a responsive theme which means it adapts to the viewing device's width, such as mobile, tablet or desktop. Mobile modes have a unique menu to aid usability. Support classes can also be used to display or hide various types of content for each device.
