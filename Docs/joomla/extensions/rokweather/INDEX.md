Introduction

![][rokweather]
RokWeather is an Ajax-powered weather module which utilizes the Yahoo or Wunderground APIs to display weather data and related information from regions all across the globe.

Included are options to display temperature, climate, wind speed as well as frontend based location user interaction, default location settings and cookie enabling options.

Requirements
------------
RokWeather has the following requirements in order to operate:

* Joomla 3.x - ensure you are using the latest version
* Compatible Browsers: Firefox, Chrome, Safari, IE8+, Opera.

>> NOTE: Internet Explorer 11+ and Edge are supported, but versions 8, 9, and 10 are no longer supported by Microsoft and while they may work, are not recommended.

Key Features
------------
* **Graphical Representation**: the module is packaged with images to showcase all types of weather from rain to sunshine
* **Location Chooser**: click the current area and type your desired location and the module will show the appropriate weather, with both frontend and backend configuration options
* **Temperature Units**: RokWeather has support for both the Fahrenheit and Celsius temperature scales
