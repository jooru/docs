Introduction
-----
![][rokgallery]

RokGallery is a revolutionary ground-up gallery extension developed to be highly flexible, versatile, and user friendly. The system itself is built on a custom tag-based architecture with the ability to have multiple tag-based galleries.

RokGallery uses design and concepts that have been traditionally reserved for platform-native applications and are for the first time making their way into a web environment.

RokBox
-----

We recommend downloading and installing [RokBox][rokbox] in addition to RokGallery. RokBox is a useful companion extension to RokGallery which enables you to make media files available to visitors in an elegant frame without having to leave the page to do so. By linking a RokGallery module to RokBox, you will be able to present images in a way that goes beyond what RokGallery alone can offer.

In addition, RokBox gives you more media options for other areas of your site apart from RokGallery.
