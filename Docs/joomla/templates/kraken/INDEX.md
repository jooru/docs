New to Gantry 5?
-----
If you are new to Gantry 5, a good place to start would be our [dedicated Gantry documentation](http://docs.gantry.org).

As a Joomla user, you are most likely accustomed to editing modules when working with our Gantry 4 templates. While our RocketLauncher package contains modules for our subpages, the Home page content is specifically found in the template's Layout. This can be found via your Joomla administrator -> Extensions -> Templates - > Home -> Layout. Click on any of the cog icons on the Particles to edit the content.

## FixedSide

![FixedSide](ft-2.jpg)

The FixedSide position is similar to offcanvas, by allowing you to position blocks outside of the main wrapper of the template. For Kraken, FixedSide contains the logo, social icons and menu, but can be adjusted to use whatever blocks you prefer.

## Particles

![Particles](ft-3.jpg)

Kraken includes a selection of custom Particles available for demonstration in our Typography page. Particles operate as customizable blocks that form the flesh of the frontend, from placeholders to self contained content and functions.

## Responsive

![Responsive](ft-4.jpg)

Kraken is a responsive template which means it adapts to the viewing device's width, such as mobile, tablet or desktop. Mobile modes have a unique menu to aid usability. Support classes can also be used to display or hide various types of content for each device.
