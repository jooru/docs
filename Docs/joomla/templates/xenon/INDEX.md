Introduction
-----

Xenon is an excellent example of precision design, with refined elements and structures to combine vibrancy, elegance and flexibility within one entity. The template is saturated with rich typographical elements to enhance your content.

New to Gantry 5?
-----
If you are new to Gantry 5, a good place to start would be our [dedicated Gantry documentation](http://docs.gantry.org).

As a Joomla user, you are most likely accustomed to editing modules when working with our Gantry 4 templates. While our RocketLauncher package contains modules for our subpages, the Home page content is specifically found in the template's Layout. This can be found via your **Joomla administrator -> Extensions -> Templates - > Home -> Layout**. Click on any of the cog icons on the Particles to edit the content.

TThe template features a diverse collection of new particles, to enrich your site content. Xenon debuts Chartist, a visually stunning graphical chart display script, alongside the News Slider and News ticker particles, amongst several others.

## Login Popup

The Login module is now displayable in its own popup modal, allowing you to maximize screen usage and still providing an easy to access method for logging into your site. Modals are used intuitively throughout the Gantry 5 Framework.

## Responsive

![Responsive](ft-4.jpg)

Xenon is a responsive template which means it adapts to the viewing device's width, such as mobile, tablet or desktop. Mobile modes have a unique menu to aid usability. Support classes can also be used to display or hide various types of content for each device.
