Audacity is a modern, sectioned based design, with a diverse infusion of background textures and patterns. These enrich and differentiate your site whilst maintaining an overall conservative approach, for flexible site application.

New to Gantry 5?
-----
If you are new to Gantry 5, a good place to start would be our [dedicated Gantry documentation](http://docs.gantry.org).

As a Joomla user, you are most likely accustomed to editing modules when working with our Gantry 4 templates. While our RocketLauncher package contains modules for our subpages, the Home page content is specifically found in the template's Layout. This can be found via your Joomla administrator -> Extensions -> Templates - > Home -> Layout. Click on any of the cog icons on the Particles to edit the content.

The Dropdown Menu is an advanced, CSS based menu system, which offers a wide range of per menu item options, such as: inline subtext, icons, images, custom column widths and number, as well as control over how menu items are distributed between columns.

## Responsive

Audacity is a responsive template which means it adapts to the viewing device's width, such as mobile, tablet or desktop. Mobile modes have a unique menu to aid usability. Support classes can also be used to display or hide various types of content for each device.
