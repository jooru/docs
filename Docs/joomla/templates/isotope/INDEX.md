New to Gantry 5?
-----
If you are new to Gantry 5, a good place to start would our [dedicated Gantry documentation](http://docs.gantry.org).

As a Joomla user, you are most likely accustomed to editing modules when working with our Gantry 4 templates. While our RocketLauncher package contains modules for our subpages, the Home page content is specifically found in the template's Layout. This can be found via your Joomla administrator -> Extensions -> Templates - > Home -> Layout. Click on any of the cog icons on the Particles to edit the content.

The template features a range of custom particles, including Popup Grid, a mosaic styled content element. It supports a custom modal effect which is a full screen overlay for an enlarged image and full length content items, with easy configuration.

## Menu Overlay

Isotope features two custom menu options. The Menu Overlay is displayed in a fixed, full width overlay, with support for additional blocks. An inline, horizontal option is also available, with Headroom support for dynamic scrolling.

## Responsive

![Responsive](ft-4.jpg)

Isotope is a responsive template which means it adapts to the viewing device's width, such as mobile, tablet or desktop. Mobile modes have a unique menu to aid usability. Support classes can also be used to display or hide various types of content for each device.
