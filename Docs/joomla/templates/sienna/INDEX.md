New to Gantry 5?

If you are new to Gantry 5, a good place to start would our [dedicated Gantry documentation](http://docs.gantry.org).

As a Joomla user, you are most likely accustomed to editing modules when working with our Gantry 4 templates. While our RocketLauncher package contains modules for our subpages, the Home page content is specifically found in the template's Layout. This can be found via your Joomla administrator -> Extensions -> Templates - > Home -> Layout. Click on any of the cog icons on the Particles to edit the content.
