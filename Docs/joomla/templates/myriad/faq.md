What is Gantry?
-----

[Gantry][gantry] is, as a basic definition, a framework used for assembling, building and maintaining a RocketTemplate template. It is an advanced platform for dramatically extending the capabilities of the entire theming system of Joomla.

Can I install RocketLauncher onto an existing Joomla website?
-----

No. RocketLauncher will install both Joomla and the demo sample content and images, so you will need a fresh Joomla installation.

I installed Myriad RocketLauncher but the images are different with the demo site.
-----

To avoid image license copyright issues, all sample content images shown in our demo site will be replaced with blank versions in the RocketLauncher version.
