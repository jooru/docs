New to Gantry 5?
-----
If you are new to Gantry 5, a good place to start would be our [dedicated Gantry documentation](http://docs.gantry.org).

As a Joomla user, you are most likely accustomed to editing modules when working with our Gantry 4 templates. While our RocketLauncher package contains modules for our subpages, the Home page content is specifically found in the template's Layout. This can be found via your Joomla administrator -> Extensions -> Templates - > Home -> Layout. Click on any of the cog icons on the Particles to edit the content.

## Dynamic Header

![Layout Manager](ft-2.jpg)

The Dynamic, Scrolling Header, is a custom design feature that adds an animation effect the header, where the logo and menu are contained, whereby the header elegantly collapses upon downward scroll and smoothly reappears on upward scroll.

## Color Chooser

![Style Settings](ft-3.jpg)

Anacron has an extensive Color Chooser in the template manager to provide intricate controls for each section of Anacron, inclusive of overlay type, text color, background color, as well as background images. Edit preexisting or create new presets

## Responsive

![Responsive](ft-4.jpg)

Anacron is a responsive theme which means it adapts to the viewing device's width, such as mobile, tablet or desktop. Mobile modes have a unique menu to aid usability. Support classes can also be used to display or hide various types of content for each device.
