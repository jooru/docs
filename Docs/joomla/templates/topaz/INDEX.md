New to Gantry 5?
-----
If you are new to Gantry 5, a good place to start would our [dedicated Gantry documentation](http://docs.gantry.org).

As a Joomla user, you are most likely accustomed to editing modules when working with our Gantry 4 templates. While our RocketLauncher package contains modules for our subpages, the Home page content is specifically found in the template's Layout. This can be found via your Joomla administrator -> Extensions -> Templates - > Home -> Layout. Click on any of the cog icons on the Particles to edit the content.

This template features a versatile and diverse catalog of particles, to enrich your site content. Besides adding the brandnew BookBlock and Joomla Articles particles, we have also restyled some of our existing particles, such as the Grid Statistic.

## Typography

Typography is an important instrument in not only the site design, but how your content is portrayed and utilised by your visitors. Therefore, Topaz offers a rich selection of elegant typography to provide focus to varying content types.

## Responsive

Topaz is a responsive template which means it adapts to the viewing device's width, such as mobile, tablet or desktop. Mobile modes have a unique menu to aid usability. Support classes can also be used to display or hide various types of content for each device.
