Introduction

Notio is a brilliant theme for displaying big, beautiful images alongside modern charts and text. It features several new premium particles that make it easy to create easy-to-read charts, calendars, content blocks, and more.

New to Gantry 5?
-----
If you are new to Gantry 5, a good place to start would be our [dedicated Gantry documentation](http://docs.gantry.org).

As a Joomla user, you are most likely accustomed to editing modules when working with our Gantry 4 templates. While our RocketLauncher package contains modules for our subpages, the Home page content is specifically found in the template's Layout. This can be found via your **Joomla administrator -> Extensions -> Templates - > Home -> Layout**. Click on any of the cog icons on the Particles to edit the content.

Typography is an important instrument in not only the site design, but how your content is portrayed and utilized by your visitors. Therefore, Notio offers a rich selection of elegant typography to provide focus to varying content types.

## Responsive

![Responsive](ft-3.jpg)

Notio is a responsive template which means it adapts to the viewing device's width, such as mobile, tablet or desktop. Mobile modes have a unique menu to aid usability. Support classes can also be used to display or hide various types of content for each device.

## Inheritance

Notio takes full advantage of Gantryâ€™s new inheritance system, making it easier than ever to configure and manage your website through synced particles, atoms, sections, and layouts. Save time by using inheritance to avoid repetitive changes!
