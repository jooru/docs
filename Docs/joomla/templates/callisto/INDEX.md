New to Gantry 5?
-----
If you are new to Gantry 5, a good place to start would our [dedicated Gantry documentation](http://docs.gantry.org).

As a Joomla user, you are most likely accustomed to editing modules when working with our Gantry 4 templates. While our RocketLauncher package contains modules for our subpages, the Home page content is specifically found in the template's Layout. This can be found via your Joomla administrator -> Extensions -> Templates - > Home -> Layout. Click on any of the cog icons on the Particles to edit the content.

## Layout Manager

The Gantry 5 Layout manager benefits from a drag and drop interface, providing an easy mechanism for configuring positions and particles. Furthermore, there are now no restrictions to the number of positions you can have and are truly unlimited.

## Style Settings

Callisto's pre-built presets are displayed in the Styles tab for you to preview, individually customize and apply. You'll also find an assortment of individual style options, such as text and background colors for the various sections, allowing for easy color changes.

## Responsive

A responsive layout adapts to the viewing device's width, such as mobile, tablet or desktop. Mobile modes have a unique menu to aid usability. Support classes can also be used to display or hide various types of content for each device.
