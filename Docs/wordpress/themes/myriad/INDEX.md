The theme makes uses of animated effects to add depth and character to content, without compromising on usability and professionalism. A series of bounce and slide effects are built into Myriad, as triggered by scroll events, with an option to disable them.

## Color Chooser

![Style Settings](ft-3.jpg)

Myriad has an extensive Color Chooser in the theme manager to provide intricate controls for each section, inclusive of overlay type, text color, background color, as well as accent colors. Edit preexisting or create new presets.

## Responsive

Myriad is a responsive theme which means it adapts to the viewing device's width, such as mobile, tablet or desktop. Mobile modes have a unique menu to aid usability. Support classes can also be used to display or hide various types of content for each device.
