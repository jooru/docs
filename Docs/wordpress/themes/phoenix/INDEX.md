New to Gantry 5?
-----
If you are new to Gantry 5, a good place to start would be our [dedicated Gantry documentation](http://docs.gantry.org).

As a WordPress user, you are most likely accustomed to editing modules when working with our Gantry 4 themes. While our RocketLauncher package contains modules for our subpages, the Home page content is specifically found in the theme's Layout. This can be found via your **WordPress administrator -> Extensions -> Themes - > Home -> Layout**. Click on any of the cog icons on the Particles to edit the content.

## Responsive

Phoenix is a responsive theme which means it adapts to the viewing device's width, such as mobile, tablet or desktop. Mobile modes have a unique menu to aid usability. Support classes can also be used to display or hide various types of content for each device.

## Inheritance

Phoenix takes full advantage of Gantryâ€™s new inheritance system, making it easier than ever to configure and manage your website through synced particles, atoms, sections, and layouts. Save time by using inheritance to avoid repetitive changes!
