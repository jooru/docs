No, Phoenix is only compatible with WordPress 3.4+.

## What is Gantry?

[Gantry][gantry] is, as a basic definition, a framework used for assembling, building and maintaining a RocketTheme theme. It is an advanced platform for dramatically extending the capabilities of the entire theming system of WordPress.

## Can I install RocketLauncher onto an existing WordPress! website?

No. RocketLauncher will install both WordPress and the demo sample content and images, so you will need a fresh WordPress! installation.

## I installed Phoenix RocketLauncher but the images are different with the demo site.

To avoid image license copyright issues, all sample content images shown in our demo site will be replaced with blank versions in the RocketLauncher version.
