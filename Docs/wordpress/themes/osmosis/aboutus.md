Introduction
-----

The **About Us** example page demonstrates how you can create a beautiful page with the Osmosis theme. Here is some information to help you replicate this page as it appears in the demo.

Theme Override Options
-----

![][aboutuspage2]

The **About Us** page is a regular **Page**. To recreate the layout the way it appears in our demo, enter `menu-about-us` in the **Page Suffix** field in the **Gizmos** page inside the **Osmosis** theme settings. This suffix is tied to a class in the demo.less file that sets the page up so it appears the way it does in the demo.

In order for this to work, you should have the **Page Suffix** option set to **On** in **Admin > Osmosis > Gizmos**. You will likely need to create a theme override specifically for the page before assigning that suffix to it. For more information on creating theme overrides, visit our [Gantry Documentation][gantrydocs]
