Introduction
-----

The **Blog** example page demonstrates how you can create a beautiful page with the Osmosis theme. Here is some information to help you replicate this page as it appears in the demo.

Theme Override Options
-----

![][blogpage14]

The **Blog** page is a regular **Page**. To recreate the layout the way it appears in our demo, enter `menu-blog` in the **Page Suffix** field in the **Gizmos** page inside the **Osmosis** theme settings. This suffix is tied to a class in the demo.less file that sets the page up so it appears the way it does in the demo.

In order for this to work, you should have the **Page Suffix** option set to **On** in **Admin > Osmosis > Gizmos**. You will likely need to create a theme override specifically for the page before assigning that suffix to it. For more information on creating theme overrides, visit our [Gantry Documentation][gantrydocs]

Mainbody

![][blogpage4]

The page's content body is set to display posts in the **Blog** category. The first post is the **Powered by Gantry Framework** post. You will find the content used in the post below.

~~~ .html
<p><span class="rt-image"><img src="http://demo.rockettheme.com/live/wordpress/osmosis/wp-content/rockettheme/rt_osmosis_wp/pages/blog/img-01.jpg" alt="image" /></span></p>

<p>Collaboratively administrate empowered markets via plug-and-play networks. Dynamically procrastinate B2C users after installed base benefits. Dramatically visualize customer directed convergence without revolutionary ROI.</p>

<p>Efficiently unleash cross-media information without cross-media value. Quickly maximize timely deliverables for real-time schemas. Dramatically maintain clicks-and-mortar solutions without functional solutions.</p>
