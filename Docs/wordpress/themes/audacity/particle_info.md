## Introduction

![Info List](assets/particle_info1.png)

The **Info List** particle is an excellent choice for any situation where you want to create a content block that lists features and other tidbits of information.

Here are the topics covered in this guide:

* [Configuration](#configuration)
  * [Main Options](#main-options)
  * [Item Options](#item-options)

## Configuration

### Main Options

These options affect the main area of the particle, and not the individual items within. You can set the title of the particle, as well as give it an introductory paragraph here.

### Item Options

These items make up the individual featured items in the particle. They sit apart from the particle's title and introduction. Each item can have its own properties, including icons and written content.
