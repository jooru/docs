This area of the front page is a post. We assigned it the **Front Page** category which is called to the front page of our demo by setting it as the default **Blog View** category. You can do this by navigating to **Admin -> Kirigami Theme -> Content -> Blog View** and entering the blog category you wish to have appear on the content area of the front page. In this instance, we set the **Posts Display -> Intro Posts** option to **1** in order to only show a single post in that space.

>> NOTE: You can find out the category number of a particular post category by editing the category in **Admin -> Posts -> Categories**. In the category editor screen, the URL will contain a sting similar to `tag_ID=2` The **tag_ID** number in the URL is the category number.

You will also want to make sure that **Advanced -> Display Content** is turned **On** for the front page.

Here is the content body of the post.

    <p>The main focus of the <strong>Kirigami</strong> release, is its Responsive Layout. <span class="hidden-tablet"><strong>Responsive</strong> effectively means a design that will adapt automatically to match whatever device or window size is loading it.</span></p> 

    <p>Therefore, you can have one theme that will adjust itself to a <strong>mobile</strong>, tablet or desktop, without necessarily needing to load a separate layout with different content.</p>
