The **Contact Us** example page demonstrates how you can create a beautiful contact page with the Audacity theme. Here is some information to help you replicate this page as it appears in the demo.

The contact page's content is blank. The contact form is loaded as the result of setting the **Theme** in the **Page Attributes** section of the sidebar to **Contact Form**. This form is loaded from the `theme-contact.php` file located in the theme's directory.
