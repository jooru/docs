Introduction

The **Contact Us** example page demonstrates how you can create a beautiful contact page with the Cygnet theme. Here is some information to help you replicate this page as it appears in the demo.

Mainbody

![Mainbody](page_contactus_5.png)

The **Contact Us** page is a common WordPress page. The page's content is blank. The contact form is loaded as the result of setting the **Template** in the **Page Attributes** section of the sidebar to **Contact Form**. This form is loaded from the `theme-contact.php` file located in the theme's directory.

Widgets

Below is a brief rundown of the widgets used to make up the demo page. Widgets in the [**Header**](demo_header.md) and [**Copyright**](demo_copyright.md) positions are outlined in the main demo replication area of this guide.
