## Content Animations

![Layout Manager](ft-2.jpg)

Content is the core of any website. Nevertheless, the presentation must also be inviting, vibrant and engaging to give the content life and interest. With Vermilion, this is aided through subtle, non-intrusive but visually stunning content animations.

## Parallax

![Style Settings](ft-3.jpg)

Parallax is the apparent motion of a 3D object as based against your perspective, in short, an object appears to move as your glance changes. This effect has been transposed into the full page's background image, as varying between presets.

## Font Awesome

![Responsive](ft-4.jpg)

The template features the Font Awesome library. Font Awesome offers over 350 icons, which are fully scalable and easy to integrate into the design of the template and/or content, from widget titles to inside content items themselves.
