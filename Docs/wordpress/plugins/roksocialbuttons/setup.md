Introduction
-----

Configuring and setting up RokSocialButtons is a fairly straightforward process. Most of the work is done by the plugin itself, but you do have the ability to turn certain buttons on or off, as well as add unique CSS styling to them.

Settings

RokSocialButtons uses the [AddThis](http://www.addthis.com/) system for generating social sharing links. If you have an [AddThis](http://www.addthis.com/) account, you can take your social sharing a step further using the AddThis ID which gives you tracking and analytics capabilities.
