Plugin Settings
-----

Getting to the primary RokAjaxSearch settings menu is fairly straightforward. While RokAjaxSearch is identified as a widget, it is centrally managed via its Plugins page which can be found (once it is activated) under the Plugins area of the main Admin menu on the backend of WordPress. This settings page has a variety of different customization commands and options for you to choose from.

All settings set through this page affect every instance of the RokAjaxSearch widget. The widget itself can only be given a custom title by default, with other display options available via a separate plugin (such as Gantry).
