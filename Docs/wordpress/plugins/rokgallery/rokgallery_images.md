Image Editing in RokGallery
-----
RokGallery is not a full-fledged image editing solution, but it can be used to crop and resize images so that they fit within your site's layout. Because RokGallery preserves the original image, these edits are saved separately and referred to as slices. A single image in RokGallery can have as many slices as you need to fit various RokGallery widgets placed in your site. These slices can be created by the RokGallery Image Editor and further refined using the Slice Editor.

### RokGallery Image Editor

The RokGallery Image Editor is available to you from within the RokGallery component administration interface found in **Admin -> RokGallery Admin**. By clicking on an image's edit icon **(1)**, a panel appears which gives you direct access to the image's title, slug (URL-friendly title), description, tags, and its slices.
